# Basic Example

This is the most basic example of running the module.
This example has the most assumptions and performs the easiest path for the code.
WARNING! This downloads files from the Rancher/Rke2 code repo "releases" that are a bit large ( >1GB).

Assumptions:

- you are able to connect to the internet
- you have github access and you have set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to a GitHub token
- you have read access to the rke2 code repository in GitHub
- you have Nix installed and you are in the nix-shell generated by the flake.nix file in the base of this repo
- you are sourcing the .envrc and you have the proper rc files in the proper places so they can be sourced as well
- you are using the latest version of Terraform (or at least the latest version published to Nix packages)
- you have at least 2GB storage space available on the local filesystem to download the artifacts

## Known Issues

- if you download the images as one type, don't remove them then change the type
  - the 'file' external data provider doesn't see the change and doesn't remove the old files
  - if you are going to change the type, please delete any files of the previous type
